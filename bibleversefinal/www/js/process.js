		<h1>Children Bible Verses</h1>
				Anyone raising children knows how difficult things can get but also what a blessing the children are. Read verses 
from the Holy Bible about children in relation to God, Jesus Christ, and the Christian faith<br/>
			<h2>Psalm 127:3-5</h2>
Sons are a heritage from the LORD, children a reward from him. Like arrows 
in the hands of a warrior are sons born in one's youth. Blessed is the man whose 
quiver is full of them. They will not be put to shame when they contend with their enemies in the gate.

<h2>Genesis 33:5</h2>
Then Esau looked up and saw the women and children. "Who are these with you?" he asked. 
Jacob answered, "They are the children God has graciously given your servant."

<h2>Psalm 139:13-16</h2>
For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother's womb. I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. 
Wonderful are your works; my soul knows it very well. My frame was not hidden from you, when I was being made in secret, 
intricately woven in the depths of the earth. Your eyes saw my unformed substance; in your book were written, every one 
of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there was none of them.

He settles the barren woman in her home as a happy mother of children. Praise the LORD.

remembers the anguish, for joy that a human being has been born into the world. 

<h2>Isaiah 54:13</h2>
All your children shall be taught by the Lord, and great shall be the peace of your children.

<h2>2 Timothy 3:14-15</h2>

know those from whom you learned it,  and how from infancy you have known the holy 
Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.

the children shouting in the temple area, "Hosanna to the Son of David," they were indignant.

never read, " 'From the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise' ?"

<h2>Matthew 18:2-6</h2>
<p>He called a little child and had him stand among them.  And he said: "I tell you the truth, 
unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. 
Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. 
"And whoever welcomes a little child like this in my name welcomes me. But if anyone 
causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to 
have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.</p>

now that you have tasted that the Lord is good.</p>

not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.  I tell you the truth, anyone who 
will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it." 
And he took the children in his arms, put his hands on them and blessed them.</p>

will be mighty in the land; the generation of the upright will be blessed. Wealth and riches are in his house, 
and his righteousness endures forever. Light dawns in the darkness for the upright; he is gracious, merciful, 
and righteous. It is well with the man who deals generously and lends; who conducts his affairs with justice.</p>

road, when you lie down and when you get up.</p>

<p>Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.  "Honor your father and mother"--which is

on the earth."  Fathers, do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord.</p>

you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise.</p>

a garland to grace your head and a chain to adorn your neck.</p>

but showing love to a thousand [generations] of those who love me and keep my commandments.</p>

				<h1>Faith Bible Verses</h1>    
    
The Bible uses the words faith and belief or believe interchangeably. Eternal life is received 
by grace through faith. Faith is the victory that overcomes the world and without faith it is 
impossible to please God (1 John 5:4; Heb 11:6)



<h2>Matthew 17:20</h2>
<p>He replied, "Because you have so little faith. I tell you the truth, 
if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 
'Move from here to there' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."</p>

<h2>Matthew 21:21</h2>
<p>Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth, if you have faith and do not doubt, 
not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this 
mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and it will be done.</p>

<h2>Matthew 14:31</h2>
<p>Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?"</p>

<h2>Matthew 15:28</h2>
<p>Then Jesus answered, "Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted." And her daughter was healed from that very hour.</p>

<h2>Matthew 9:2</h2>
<p>Some men brought to him a paralytic, lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to 
the paralytic, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."</p>

<h2>Hebrews 11:1</h2>
<p>Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.</p>

<h2>1 Peter 1:21</h2>
<p>Through him you believe in God, who raised him from the dead and glorified him, and so your faith and hope are in God.</p>

<h2>1 Peter 1:7</h2>
<p>These have come so that your faith--of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though 
refined by fire--may be proved genuine and may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed.</p>

<h2>Titus 1:2</h2>
<p>A faith and knowledge resting on the hope of eternal life, which God, who does not lie, promised before the beginning of time,</p>

<h2>2 Corinthians 5:7</h2>
<p>We live by faith, not by sight.</p>

<h2>1 Corinthians 15:14-17</h2>
<p>And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith.  More than that, 
we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God that he raised 
Christ from the dead. But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised. 
For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either. 
And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins.</p>

<h2>1 Peter 1:5-9</h2>
<p>Who through faith are shielded by God's power until the coming of the salvation that is ready 
to be revealed in the last time.  In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while 
you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials. These have come so that your 
faith--of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire--may 
be proved genuine and may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed. 
Though you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you 
believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy, 
for you are receiving the goal of your faith, the salvation of your souls.</p>

<h2>1 John 5:4</h2>
<p>For everyone born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith.</p>

<h2>1 Corinthians 16:13</h2>
<p>Be on your guard; stand firm in the faith; be men of courage; be strong.</p>

<h2>1 Timothy 6:11</h2>
<p>But you, man of God, flee from all this, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance and gentleness.</p>

<h2>1 Peter 5:9</h2>
<p>Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that your brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kind of sufferings.</p>

<h2>1 Thessalonians 1:3</h2>
<p>We continually remember before our God and Father your work produced by faith, 
your labor prompted by love, and your endurance inspired by hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<h2>1 Corinthians 2:5</h2>
<p>So that your faith might not rest on men's wisdom, but on God's power.</p>

<h2>Hebrews 11:1-39</h2>
<p>Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see. 
This is what the ancients were commended for. By faith we understand that the 
universe was formed at God's command, so that what is seen was not made out of 
what was visible. By faith Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did. 
By faith he was commended as a righteous man, when God spoke well of his offerings. 
And by faith he still speaks, even though he is dead. 
By faith Enoch was taken from this life, so that he did not experience death; 
he could not be found, because God had taken him away. For before he was taken, 
he was commended as one who pleased God.  And without faith it is impossible 
to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists 
and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him. By faith Noah, when 
warned about things not yet seen, in holy fear built an ark to save his family. 
By his faith he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness 
that comes by faith.  By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he 
would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he 
did not know where he was going.  By faith he made his home in the promised 
land like a stranger in a foreign country; he lived in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, 
who were heirs with him of the same promise. 
For he was looking forward to the city with foundations, whose architect 
and builder is God.  By faith Abraham, even though he was past age--and 
Sarah herself was barren--was enabled to become a father because 
he considered him faithful who had made the promise. 
And so from this one man, and he as good as dead, came descendants as 
numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore. 
All these people were still living by faith when they died. They did not receive 
the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance. 
And they admitted that they were aliens and strangers on earth. People who say such 
things show that they are looking for a country of their own. If they had been 
thinking of the country they had left, they would have had opportunity to return. 
Instead, they were longing for a better country--a heavenly one. Therefore God is 
not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them. 
By faith Abraham, when God tested him, offered Isaac as a sacrifice. He who had 
received the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son, even though God 
had said to him, "It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned." 
Abraham reasoned that God could raise the dead, and figuratively speaking, he 
did receive Isaac back from death. By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in 
regard to their future.  By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Joseph's 
sons, and worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff. By faith Joseph, 
when his end was near, spoke about the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt 
and gave instructions about his bones.  By faith Moses' parents hid him for 
three months after he was born, because they saw he was no ordinary child, 
and they were not afraid of the king's edict.  By faith Moses, when he had grown up, 
refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh's daughter. He chose to be mistreated along 
with the people of God rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a short time. 
He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, 
because he was looking ahead to his reward.  By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the king's 
anger; he persevered because he saw him who is invisible. By faith he kept the Passover 
and the sprinkling of blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of Israel. 
By faith the people passed through the Red Sea as on dry land; but when the Egyptians tried to do 
so, they were drowned.  By faith the walls of Jericho fell, after the people had marched around 
them for seven days.  By faith the prostitute Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not 
killed with those who were disobedient.  And what more shall I say? I do not have time to 
tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel and the prophets, who through faith 
conquered kingdoms, administered justice, and gained what was promised; who shut the mouths of lions, 
quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to 
strength; and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies. Women received back their 
dead, raised to life again. Others were tortured and refused to be released, so that they might 
gain a better resurrection.  Some faced jeers and flogging, while still others were chained and put in prison. 
They were stoned; they were sawed in two; they were put to death by the sword. They went about in 
sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and mistreated -- the world was not worthy of them. 
They wandered in deserts and mountains, and in caves and holes in the ground. These were 
all commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised.</p>

<h2>1 Thessalonians 3:7</h2>
<p>Therefore, brothers, in all our distress and persecution we were encouraged about you because of your faith.</p>

<h2>1 Corinthians 13:2</h2>
<p>If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a 
faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.</p>

<h2>2 Corinthians 1:24</h2>
<p>Not that we lord it over your faith, but we work with you for your joy, because it is by faith you stand firm.</p>

<h2>2 Timothy 4:7</h2>
<p>I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.</p>

<h2>Acts 26:18</h2>
<p>To open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that 
they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.'</p>

<h2>Ephesians 2:8</h2>
<p>For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God.</p>

<h2>Ephesians 6:16</h2>
<p>In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.</p>

<h2>Galatians 3:11-12</h2>
<p>Clearly no one is justified before God by the law, because, "The righteous will live by faith." 
The law is not based on faith; on the contrary, "The man who does these things will live by them."</p>

<h2>Galatians 3:22-26</h2>
<p>But the Scripture declares that the whole world is a prisoner of sin, so that what was promised, 
being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe. Before this faith 
came, we were held prisoners by the law, locked up until faith should be revealed. So the law was put 
in charge to lead us to Christ that we might be justified by faith. Now that faith has come, 
we are no longer under the supervision of the law.  You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.</p>

<h2>Galatians 5:5</h2>
<p>But by faith we eagerly await through the Spirit the righteousness for which we hope.</p>

<h2>Hebrews 10:22</h2>
<p>Let us draw near to God with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts

<h2>1 Corinthians 15:33</h2>

<h2>1 Corinthians 13:1-13</h2>
<p>If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a 
clanging cymbal. And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, 
and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give away 
all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing. Love is patient 
and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful;</p>

lies at home paralyzed and in terrible suffering."  Jesus said to him, "I will go and heal him."  The centurion 
replied, "Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be 
healed.  For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; 
and that one, 'Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."  When Jesus heard this, 
he was astonished and said to those following him, "I tell you the truth, I have not found anyone in Israel 
with such great faith.  I say to you that many will come from the east and the west, and will take their 
places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.  But the subjects of the kingdom 
will be thrown outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."  Then Jesus 
said to the centurion, "Go! It will be done just as you believed it would." And his servant was healed at that 
very hour.  When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever. He 
touched her hand and the fever left her, and she got up and began to wait on him.  When evening came, many

She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped. "Who touched me?" Jesus asked. 
When they all denied it, Peter said, "Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you." But Jesus said, "Someone touched me; I 
know that power has gone out from me."  Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. 
In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed. Then he said 
to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace."</p>

When he arrived at the house of Jairus, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John and James, and the child's father and mother.  Meanwhile, all the people were wailing and mourning for her. "Stop wailing," Jesus said. "She is not dead but asleep."  They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead.  But he took her by the hand and said, "My child, get up!"  Her spirit returned, and at once she stood up. Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat.  Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.</p>

                    <h1>Love Bible Verses</h1>    

The Word of God contains a treasure trove of Bible verses about love. You'll find passages 
that speak of romantic love, brotherly love, and divine love.


<h2>Mark 12:31</h2>
<p>The second is this: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these."</p>

<h2>Colossians 3:14</h2>
<p>And above all these put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony.</p>

<p>Do to others as you would have them do to you.</p>

<h2>Luke 6:35</h2>
<p>But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without 
expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, 
and you will be sons of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.</p>

<h2>1 John 4:8</h2>
<p>Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love.</p>

<h2>John 15:13</h2>
<p>Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends.</p>  

<h2>John 8:13</h2>
<p>The Pharisees challenged him, "Here you are, appearing as your own witness; your testimony is not valid."</p>

<h2>Romans 12:9</h2>
<p>Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good.</p>

<h2>1 Corinthians 16:14</h2>

<h2>John 13:34-35</h2>
<p>A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to 
love one another. By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”</p>  

<h2>Romans 13:10</h2>
<p>Love does no harm to its neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.</p>

<h2>1 Corinthians 13:4-8</h2>
<p>Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, 
it is not proud.  It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not 
easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.  Love does not delight 
in evil but rejoices with the truth.  It always protects, always 
trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.  Love never fails. But where 
there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will 
be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.</p>

<h2>1 Corinthians 13:13</h2>
<p>And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.</p>

<h2>Ephesians 4:2</h2>

<h2>1 John 4:18-19</h2>
<p>There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has 
to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.  We love because he first loved us.</p>

<h2>John 15:13</h2>
<p>Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.</p>

And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in one body. And be thankful.</p> 

<h2>Ephesians 5:33</h2>
<p>However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.</p>

<h2>Proverbs 17:17</h2>
<p>A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.</p>

<h2>1 John 3:16-18</h2>
<p>This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we 
ought to lay down our lives for our brothers.  If anyone has material possessions and 
sees his brother in need but has no pity on him, how can the love of God be in him? 
Dear children, let us not love with words or tongue but with actions and in truth.</p>

<h2>1 John 4:8</h2>
<p>Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.</p>

seven, since all of them were married to her?"  Jesus replied, "You are in error because 
you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God.</p>

<h2>Deuteronomy 10:12-19</h2>
<p>And now, O Israel, what does the LORD your God ask of you but to fear the LORD your God, 
to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and 
with all your soul,  and to observe the LORD's commands and decrees that I am giving you 
today for your own good?  To the LORD your God belong the heavens, even the highest 
heavens, the earth and everything in it.  Yet the LORD set his affection on your forefathers 
and loved them, and he chose you, their descendants, above all the nations, as it is today. 
Circumcise your hearts, therefore, and do not be stiff-necked any longer. 
For the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, mighty and awesome, 
who shows no partiality and accepts no bribes.  He defends the cause of the fatherless and 
the widow, and loves the alien, giving him food and clothing. And you are to love those who 
are aliens, for you yourselves were aliens in Egypt.</p>

<h2>Deuteronomy 11:13-22</h2>
<p>So if you faithfully obey the commands I am giving you today -- to love the LORD your 
God and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul --  then I will send rain 
on your land in its season, both autumn and spring rains, so that you may gather in your 
grain, new wine and oil. I will provide grass in the fields for your cattle, and you will 
eat and be satisfied. Be careful, or you will be enticed to turn away and worship other 
gods and bow down to them.  Then the LORD's anger will burn against you, and he will 
shut the heavens so that it will not rain and the ground will yield no produce, and 
you will soon perish from the good land the LORD is giving you. Fix these words of 
mine in your hearts and minds; tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on 
your foreheads. Teach them to your children, talking about them when you sit at home 
and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. Write them 
on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates, so that your days and the 
days of your children may be many in the land that the LORD swore to give your 
forefathers, as many as the days that the heavens are above the earth. If you 
carefully observe all these commands I am giving you to follow -- to love the LORD your God, to 
walk in all his ways and to hold fast to him.</p>

<h2>Song of Solomon 8:4-8</h2>
<p>Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you: Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires. 
Who is this coming up from the desert leaning on her lover? Under the apple tree I roused 
you; there your mother conceived you, there she who was in labor gave you birth. Place me 
like a seal over your heart, like a seal on your arm; for love is as strong as death, its 
jealousy unyielding as the grave. It burns like blazing fire, like a mighty flame. 
Many waters cannot quench love; rivers cannot wash it away. If one were to give all the 
wealth of his house for love, it would be utterly scorned. We have a young sister, 
and her breasts are not yet grown. What shall we do for our sister for the day she is spoken for?</p>

<h2>Matthew 6:24</h2>
<p>"No one can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or 
he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money.</p>

<h2>Matthew 22:37-39</h2>
<p>Jesus replied: "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your 
soul and with all your mind." This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second 
is like it: "Love your neighbor as yourself."</p>

<h2>Matthew 23:6-8</h2>
<p>They love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the 
synagogues;  they love to be greeted in the marketplaces and to have men call them 'Rabbi.' 
"But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for you have only one Master and you are all brothers.</p>

                    <h1>Relationship Bible Verses</h1>   

Our earthly relationships are important to the Lord. God the Father ordained the 
institution of marriage and designed for us to live within families. Whether we're 
talking about friendships, dating relationships, marriages, families, or dealings 
between brothers and sisters in Christ, the Bible has a great deal to say about our 
relationships with one another.

Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</p>

Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.</p>

<p>Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. 
Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.</p>

 <h2>Ecclesiastes 4:9-12</h2>
 <p>Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil. For if they fall, one will lift up 
 his fellow. But woe to him who is alone when he falls and has not another to lift him up! Again, if two lie 
 together, they keep warm, but how can one keep warm alone? And though a man might prevail against one who 
 is alone, two will withstand him—a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</p>

<h2>1 Peter 1:3-5</h2>
<p>Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy he has 
given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 
and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade--kept in heaven for you, 
who through faith are shielded by God's power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time.</p>

<h2>1 Timothy 5:1-7</h2>

parents, for this is pleasing in the sight of God. She who is truly a widow, left all alone, has set her hope on 
God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day,</p>
